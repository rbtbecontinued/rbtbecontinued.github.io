== About Me
~~~
I am now working toward my Ph.D. degree with the School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, UNSW, Sydney. \nMy background is in communications and signal processing. I received the M.Eng.Sc. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai \nin 2015, under the supervision of [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bQBku50AAAAJ Prof. Xin Wang]. Before I started my Ph.D., I was a Researcher with the Radar Research AVIC, \nBeijing (2015–2018), and an Algorithm Engineer with the Ride-Hailing Business Unit, Meituan, Beijing (2018–2021).

My current research interests lie in *signal processing*, *machine learning*, and *graph theory*.

I am fortunate to be advised by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gsx__zkAAAAJ Dr. Vidhyasaharan Sethu], [https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=Sb1Pj4sAAAAJ Dr. Ting Dang], and [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=crMO9PcAAAAJ&hl=en Dr. Beena Ahmed].
